         *   components of the `/set_speed` message
         *   represents respectively the left and right motor speed in (rad/s)
         * - `/node/cmd_vel` of type `geometry_msgs::Twist`: The linear and angular
         *   velocities.
         * The controller publishes the odometry to `/node/odom` and TFs, the safety
         * functions to `/node/safety`.
         * 
         * DiffDriveController inheriting from rclcpp_lifecycle::LifecycleNode

         * The lifecycle talker does not like the regular "talker" node
         * inherit from node, but rather from lifecyclenode. This brings
         * in a set of callbacks which are getting invoked depending on
         * the current state of the node.
         * Every lifecycle node has a set of services attached to it
         * which make it controllable from the outside and invoke state
         * changes.
